installed virtualenv on MDDBIOPS1,
but when running it, I encounter the error like prefix not python 2.7.
The reason is the virtualenv point is virtualevn-3.4.
1. I succeeded by using the --python=E:\Python2.7\python.exe option and created virtual env mlf (machine learning foundations).
2. mlf/Scripts/activate  to make mlf active.
3. Then when I tried to use pip to install packages in mlf, I encountered error "No module named _socket".
4. I overcame this problem by setting PYTHONPATH=E:\Python2.7;E:\Python2.7\Lib;E:\Python2.7\DLLs. (set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;E:\Python27\DLLs)

10/12/2015:
Forget how to run Ipython server on mddboops1:
(1) Start mlf
(2) Remember to set PYTHONPATH=E:\Python27\DLLs
(3) G:\Temp\Anhua\mlf\Scripts\ipython notebook
To use GraphLab Create:
set GRAPHLAB_PRODUCT_KEY=E860-72A9-538A-491D-3FFE-337C-2B55-1196

trouble installing scipy on windows, 
go to "http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/" to download the corresponding wheel and put it in the site packages.
do pip install ..\sitepackage\...whl

installed python 2.7.11, virtualenv on my computer.
create virtualenv datascience, installed jupyter, then encountered the problem of 0 kernel and blank page.
It turns out to be IE problem. Used the following way to set chrome as default:
1. jupyter notebook --generate-config  (creat the config file jupyter_notebook_config.py  in C:\Users\alin\.jupyter\)
2. add 
import webbrowser
webbrowser.register('chrome', None, webbrowser.GenericBrowser(u'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'))
c.NotebookApp.browser = 'chrome'

DONE, changed to chrome and everything works.

After upgradeing python to 2.7.11, pyscripter no longer works.
Have to do the following to fix it:
Go to command line:
run: REG COPY Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\2.7 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\2.7-32 /s
What it does is to create a copy of registry key 2.7 to 2.7-32.
Registry can be checked by run "regedit"

try to insall spark.
Spark 2.0.0 doesn't work because I get Java 51.0 error, but I cannot install java8, no response.
So I installed Spark 1.3.
Got a couple Hadoop related exception.
Solution:
###################################################
The good news is you're not doing anything wrong, and your code will run after the error is mitigated.

Despite the statement that Spark will run on Windows without Hadoop, it still looks for some Hadoop components. The bug has a JIRA ticket (SPARK-2356), and a patch is available. As of Spark 1.3.1, the patch hasn't been committed to the main branch yet.

Fortunately, there's a fairly easy work around.

Create a bin directory for winutils under your Spark installation directory. In my case, Spark is installed in D:\Languages\Spark, so I created the following path: D:\Languages\Spark\winutils\bin
Download the winutils.exe from Hortonworks and put it into the bin directory created in the first step. Download link for Win64: http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/hdp-win-alpha/winutils.exe
Create a "HADOOP_HOME" environment variable that points to the winutils directory (not the bin subdirectory). You can do this in a couple of ways:
a. Establish a permanent environment variable via the Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced Tab -> Environment variables. You can create either a user variable or a system variable with the following parameters:

Variable Name=HADOOP_HOME
 Variable Value=D:\Languages\Spark\winutils\
b. Set a temporary environment variable inside your command shell before executing your script

set HADOOP_HOME=d:\\Languages\\Spark\\winutils

set HADOOP_HOME=C:\\Users\\alin\\spark-1.3.0-bin-hadoop2.4\\winutils
Run your code. It should work without error now.
