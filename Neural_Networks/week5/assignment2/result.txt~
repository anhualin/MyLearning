2. 50 embedding, 200 hidden, 10 epochs, training set CE = 2.534
3. learning rate 100.0, both training CE and validation CE fluctuates around
  a large number.
4. no training, average CE on validation set = 5.521
5. learning rate = 0.1 is best
6. same as 5.
7. A: 5 embeding, 100 hidden, 10 epochs  training CE = 2.804 , Validate CE = 2.828.
  B: 50 embedding, 10 hidden, train = 3.01  validate =
