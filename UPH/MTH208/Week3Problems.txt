1. Practice Problem (I)
  A line passes through the points (1,3) and (-4, 1). 
  (a) What is the slope of this line?
  (b) What is the y-intercept of the line?

2. Practice Problem (II)
   We have two lines L1 and L2. We know L1 and L2 are parallel to each other. We also know that the equation of L1 is 
y=3x+1.
   (a) What is the slope of L1?
   (b) What is the slope of L2? (Note: parallel lines have the same slope)
   (c) If we know the point (2,9) is on L2, what is the slope-intercept form of L2?

3. Practice Problem (III)
   Given two numbers a and b. If the product a*b = -1, we say that a and b are  negative reciprocal of each other. 
Please find the negative reciprocal of  1, 2/3,  -3/4, 6/5, -7/3.

You need to be able to find the negative reciprocal of any given number to solve the next practice problem.
4. Practice Problem (IV)
   We have two lines L1 and L2. We know L1 and L2 are perpendicular to each other. We also know that the equation of L1 is y=3x+1.
   (a) What is the slope of L1?
   (b) What is the slope of L2? (Note: the slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocal of each other
   (c) If we know the point (3,9) is on L2, what is the slope-intercept form of L2?

To find b, we just need to find a specific point on the line and plug in the corresponding x,y-coordinates. Then we will
get an equation of b solving which gives us the value of y-intercept. Exactly which point on the line that will be plugged 
into the equation doesn'ts matter. They should all give the same result.
For example, we can plug in (-4,1), in other words, x = -4, y = 1.
So y = 2/5x + b ---> 1 = 2/5 (-4) + b ----> 1 = -8/5 + b ---> b = 1 + 8/5 = 13/5.


4. Discussion Topic (I)
   Explain the concept of modeling. Can you think of a real life example?
  
Please review the quiz problems that you didn't get right and try to work them out.

How to find the slope of a line:
Given two points on a line, you can use the two point formula to find its slope: m =(y1 - y2)/(x1- x2) = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1).

For example, if we know two points (1, 2)  and (4, -1) are on a line, then we can find the slope of that line.

We have x1 = 1 and y1 = 2 (note, the first number is the x-coordinate and the second number is the y-coordinate), x2 = 4 and y2 = -1.

So the slope m = (y1 - y2)/(x1-x2) = (2 - -1)/(1 - 4) = (2 + 1) / (1-4) = 3/(-3) = -1.


A special case that often appears in tests is given the x-intercept and y-intercept and to find the slope. In this case a simplified formula

m = - y-intercept / x-intercept can be used. For example, if a line has x-intercept = 2 and y-intercept = 5, then its slope = - 5 / 2 = -5/2.
