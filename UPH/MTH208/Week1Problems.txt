AMP:
The user interface for me is different from that for your guys. So I'm not sure what worked for me will work for you. 
I'm using Google Chrome. First I got to this page of assignment 1a. In the upper right corner of chrome, there is a shield symbol. If you let your mouse stay on the shield symbol, you will see a message that this page contains scripts from unauthenticated sources. Then I clicked the shield symbol, a pop up box appeared asking me to decide whether to click "Launch the unsafe script" which I did. The page reloaded and the white space in the assignment 1a window now had a link "click here to launch". Clicking that link showed the assignment.

Again, I don't know whether it will work for you or not. If it doesn't work, please try to call tech support.
