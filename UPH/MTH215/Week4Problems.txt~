Practice problems:
(1) Hypothetically, if a bank gives saving rate of 5% compounded annually, in other words, the money will increase by 5% each year.
For example, the money at the beginning of the second year is 105% of the money at the beginning of the first year, while
the money at the beginning of the third year is 105% of the money at the beginning of the second year. Of course, this 
rate is too good to be realistic. Now suppose I put $10,000 in the account, how much money will I have after 10 years?

One thing that I don't like Excel is that it's not free. This goes with all microsoft stuff. I like many open source software such as linux, R, openoffice etc. Usually I'm willing to sacrifice a little quality for the free stuff. I'm using Excel now because it is provided by my employer. If you are interested in Excel and also programming, I would encourage you to learn some VBA which can make your excel application more powerful.

Very good. But since you already get the formula 10000 * (1+0.05)^t, you can save all those middle year calculations.

In other words, you just need to do 10000 * (1+0.05)^10 = 16288.95 which is the final answer.

You don't need to find the numbers for the 1st - 9th year.  This is the beauty of math. Once you  get it, you can save a lot of work.

For example, if I ask you to find the total money at the end of 30 year. Now you just need to do 10000 * (1+0.05)^30.

Your method is correct, although not the efficient one.
First what you have found is actually the money amount at the beginning of the 10th-year, while the problem asks you to calculate the number at the end of the 10-th year.  So you need to multiply the last number by 105% one more time.

Now suppose I ask you to find the number after 60 years (assuming that I can live that long), we don't really want to calculate 60 numbers one by one.  Let's try to find the pattern.  Each time you multiply the number from previous year by 105%.
So at the end of first year we have 10000 * 105%; at the end of the 2nd year we have 10000 * 105% * 105% = 10000 * 105% ^2;
at the end of the 3rd year we have 10000 * 105% * 105% * 105% = 10000 * 105% ^ 3.

So the pattern is that at the end of the n-th year, the total money will be 10000 * 105%^n.
Now for the 10-th year, we have 10000 * 105% ^ 10 = 10000 * 1.05^10 = $16288.95 which is the final answer.

For the 9-th year, the answer should be 10000 * 1.05 ^ 9 = 15513.28 which is about $2 more than your number.  It is because you only kept the full $ part in your earlier calculation and the cents that you "lost" get expanded into $2.

Well, if the account is growing by simple interest, then your calculation is correct. Simple interest means that only the original money can generate interest. In other words, every year the interest is the same 5% * 10000 = 500. 
Even in this case, we can calculate it more efficiently.  At the end of nth year, we have collected the annual interest n times, so our total money should be 10000 + n*500.  In particular, for the 10-th year, I will have 10000 + 10 * 500 = 15000.  This way you don't have to write all 10 numbers out. 

However, in this problem, we assume that the account is growing using annually compounded interest.  More specifically,  the interest in year 2 is generated by the total money at the end of year 1, $10,500 instead of just the original $10000. In this case the formula
becomes  10000 * 1.05 ^ n which is a huge difference when the number of years is relatively big.  To avoid repeating myself, please see my reply to Christopher's post.

Very good.  This is the beauty of math, at least to me. A simple formula can save a lot of work and really shows the pattern. Imagine if we want to know the amount after 40 years.  There are many useful exponent related formula in finance. For example,  when you take a mortgage loan, the monthly payment is calculated by

where A is the monthly payment, P is the total amount of loan, r is the monthly rate and n is the total number of months.
This formula is kind of complicated and its derivation is a little beyond this course.  If you are interested, I encourage you to do some related reading

Very good. But as I explained in another post, after we become more mature in math, we will want to find a pattern instead of calculating the numbers year by year.  For this yearly compounding interest problem, we can see that the amount of money at the end of a year is 1.05 times that at the beginning of that year.
So from the initial money I will need to multiply it by 1.05 10 times to get the amount at the end of the 10th year. In other words, the total amount is 10000 * 1.05^10 = 16288.95.


More generally, if our principal is P and the compounding interest is r per period (year, month, day etc.), then after n periods the total amount of money is P * (1+r)^n.  This problem is just a special case of this general formula with P = 10000, r = 0.05 and n = 10.



(2) The following situation can be modeled by a linear function. Write an equation for the linear function and use it to answer the given question. 
The price of a house is ​$344,000 today and rises with time at a constant rate of ​$1000 per year. How long will it take for the price to reach $351,000 ?


/************/
Your answer is correct. A function is a way to describe the relation between two variables.

In this problem, we can consider the variable P = the price of the house and t = the number of years since today.

Since the initial price is 444000 and each year the price increases by 1500. So the relation between P and t

is P = 444000 + 1500 * t or often written as P(t) = 444000 + 1500 * t. In other words, here the price P depends of t through this expression.


This equation can be used for two purposes:

1. knowing t, to find P. For example, what's the price after 10 years?  Then P(10) = 444000 + 1500 * 10 = 459000.

2. knowing P to find t.  For example, when will the price become 450000?  Then 450000 = 444000 + 1500 * t ---> 1500 * t = 450000 - 444000  ---> 1500 t = 6000 ----> t = 6000 / 1500 = 4 years.
