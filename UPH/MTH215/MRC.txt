
Hi Kimberly, I started to teach MATH 215 on Jan 3rd.  A student with a late start in my class wants to read specific parts of the textbook to prepare for the MyMathLab checkpoint and asked me which part of the textbook she should read for that. The week 1 checkpoint in MyMathLab is shown to be on a chapter called MRC which means Math Reading Connections. However when I check the book online via VitalSource, the textbook does not shown to have this chapter in it. I am puzzled and don't know how to answer the student's question. Please advise.
