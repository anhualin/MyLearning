Why do you think this course will be helpful toward for your career? What math skills from this week can you apply to your career or life?

***********************
XXXX, you are right about practice. Practice makes Perfect. This course will be a good opportunity to sharpen your math skills. And also you will learn basic statistics, how to summarize data and how to interpret study results, such as whether there is potential bias in the study design, or what are the sources of variability, etc. It will be an interesting learning experience. We are in a mordern world and data is generated every second. Everyone needs to learn math and statistics to understand the data and interpret the data. There course will be very helpful.  

**********************************
Allison,very good example of using math in one's daily job. I agree that there are problems to be solved in every career path that need math skills. Actually not only in one's job, but also every day life, if one wants to make informed decision about how much mortgage to take, what data plan to purchase, what health insurance plan to buy, all these decisions involve math and statistics.

Cassandra, you made a very good point about the importance of critical thinking in this information era. A lot of information is shared everyday via the Internet. We need to acquire the ability to think indecently and make our own judgment. Like you said, depending on the source of the information, and how the information is acquired, the conclusion may not be valid. For example, if one makes conclusion about a general matter by telephone survey on a specific area, it may be biased, because it leaves out people who are not in this area.

********************************
Some of the statistical concepts, such as hypothesis testing, confidence interval, are very difficult to understand. I still remember when I took my first statistics course, it was nonsense to me, like a foreign language. It was only after a lot of practice, I start to understand why people need concepts like those and how widely used they are in health care, economic studies, and of course various science areas.  Even in our every day life, we can see those concepts are applied. For example, when reporting a gallup poll results, usually a margin of error is reported together with the percentage, which implies how confident the people conducting the poll are about the poll results, usually a large sample size leads to a small margin of error.

*************************************************

Yes, indeed. This course is fast paced and a lot of content is squeezed into 5 weeks. We encourage you all to spend some time each day in MyMathLab. New concepts can only sink in after practice. And joining in the forum discussion is also helpful so that you can look at things from a different perspective and you know what people can do with what's taught in this class. This can also be a good source of motivation.

***************************************************
Thanks for sharing your experience, Brandi. These 5 week courses are usually designed this way, the first week or two are usually easy, but quickly there is a jump in terms of course content complexity and worked load. But if you are prepared, continuously spending enough time on this course, and distribute the work load evenly, do not wait till due date, you will be fine. I hope all of us can catch up with this rhythm and have a smooth ride.

Hi Tanya, I understand what you are talking about. When I was a student I procrastinated too. I often waited till the night before meeting my advisor to start on my research. Over the years I find that when I divide a whole task into several pieces and work one piece at a time, it is much easier for me to focus and build confidence. I encourage you to make a plan for the week's work and do some each day.

When the dots form a line, it is perfect linear correlation. when dots move away from the line, the correlation gets weaker. If one increases, the other decreases, then it is negative correlation.

All the planning tasks need statistics. Not only in predicting office supply needs, but also in other fields. For example, airline companies need to predict how much oil will be consumed in the next season, grocery stores need to predict what grocery to restock and how often, and vaccine manufactures need to predict the demand of flu vaccine in the coming year, etc. Statistics models are used in which variables are combined and work together to give an estimate of the future unknown variable.

Describe the difference between correlation and causality. Gives examples in life of correlation and causality.

Daniel, good message about distinguishing correlation and causation. It is not easy to separate the two. One way to conceptualize it goes about this. There is a latent variable, denoted as X. X causes changes in both Y and Z. We will see Z and Y are correlated, because their change are both caused by X. But there is no causal relationship between Y and Z. One example is the correlation between ice cream sale increase and drowning deaths increase. But one does not cause the other,rather both are caused by temperature increase. During hot summer, more people eat ice cream, and more people swim and unfortunately more drowning deaths.

*******************8

Daniel, this is a good question, is there causation without any correlation? Intuitively, no, but when I search online, there are posts claiming such relationship exists. However, when I read the example, I am not convinced that that is a causation. I think this question can only be answered with more research. And it comes down to the definition of causation, in statistical formulation.

******************************
As I understand it, exercise does not need to be the sole factor responsible for weight loss in order for them to form a causal relationship. Other factors may contribute to weight loss, for example, diet, reduce stress and other life style change. But as long as exercise contribute to the weight loss, they are cause and effect.

Diana, thanks for sharing with us your experince of table data usage in your work. Table data is widely used in my work too. For example, every two weeks the upper management will have a report on each person's productivity, the number of projects worked, the number of papers written, etc.Whenever one wants to summarize data, a table is surely needed.

Hi Evelyn, usually for histogram the frequency is not for a single number, but rather a range of numbers. For example, the frequency of man with age between 20 and 25, 26 and 35, 36 and 50, etc. And histogram is usually used to describe the distribution of a continuous variable. From the shape of the histogram we have an idea of what the distribution looks like.

Seems a lot of students find rounding difficult. How to do rounding really depends on how many decimal points you want to keep. For example, 3.1415926 (pi). If only keep one decimal point, it is 3.1; if two, 3.14; if three, 3.142 ( this is because it is 15 after the 4). You get the idea.

Seems everyone agrees that bar charts are easier to read than scatter plots. A scatter plot is for two variables, for example, height and weight for a person. And what to look for in a scatter plot is correlation or more complex types of relationship between the two variables. As weight usually goes up with the increase in height, we can see a positively correlated trend with the scatter plot.

I have to say, Internet has changed the way people learn. When I was in school, I studied by reading books, practicing problems, sitting in a class listening to lectures.  But nowadays people have access to a lot more resources and there are many new way of acquiring knowledge. Youtube has a lot of teaching videos, literally about every thing, math, statistics, computer science, arts, dance, you name it. And there are also websites offering online courses like coursera, Udemy,etc. some of them are even free. This is a good time for people want to learn.
