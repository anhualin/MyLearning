Why do you think this course will be helpful toward for your career? What math skills from this week can you apply to your career or life?

***********************
XXXX, you are right about practice. Practice makes Perfect. This course will be a good opportunity to sharpen your math skills. And also you will learn basic statistics, how to summarize data and how to interpret study results, such as whether there is potential bias in the study design, or what are the sources of variability, etc. It will be an interesting learning experience. We are in a mordern world and data is generated every second. Everyone needs to learn math and statistics to understand the data and interpret the data. There course will be very helpful.

Allison,very good example of using math in one's daily job. I agree that there are problems to be solved in every career path that need math skills. Actually not only in one's job, but also every day life, if one wants to make informed decision about how much mortgage to take, what data plan to purchase, what health insurance plan to buy, all these decisions involve math and statistics.

Cassandra, you made a very good point about the importance of critical thinking in this information era. A lot of information is shared everyday via the Internet. We need to acquire the ability to think indecently and make our own judgment. Like you said, depending on the source of the information, and how the information is acquired, the conclusion may not be valid. For example, if one makes conclusion about a general matter by telephone survey on a specific area, it may be biased, because it leaves out people who are not in this area.

********************************
Some of the statistical concepts, such as hypothesis testing, confidence interval, are very difficult to understand. I still remember when I took my first statistics course, it was nonsense to me, like a foreign language. It was only after a lot of practice, I start to understand why people need concepts like those and how widely used they are in health care, economic studies, and of course various science areas.  Even in our every day life, we can see those concepts are applied. For example, when reporting a gallup poll results, usually a margin of error is reported together with the percentage, which implies how confident the people conducting the poll are about the poll results, usually a large sample size leads to a small margin of error.

*************************************************

Yes, indeed. This course is fast paced and a lot of content is squeezed into 5 weeks. We encourage you all to spend some time each day in MyMathLab. New concepts can only sink in after practice. And joining in the forum discussion is also helpful so that you can look at things from a different perspective and you know what people can do with what's taught in this class. This can also be a good source of motivation.

Thanks for sharing your experience, Brandi. These 5 week courses are usually designed this way, the first week or two are usually easy, but quickly there is a jump in terms of course content complexity and worked load. But if you are prepared, continuously spending enough time on this course, and distribute the work load evenly, do not wait till due date, you will be fine. I hope all of us can catch up with this rhythm and have a smooth ride.

Describe the difference between correlation and causality. Gives examples in life of correlation and causality.

Daniel, good message about distinguishing correlation and causation. It is not easy to separate the two. One way to conceptualize it goes about this.There is a latent variable, denoted as X. X causes changes in both Y and Z. We will see Z and Y are correlated, because their change are both caused by X. But there is no causal relationship between Y and Z. One example is the correlation between ice cream sale increase and drowning deaths increase. But one does not cause the other,rather both are caused by temperature increase. During hot summer, more people eat ice cream, and more people swim and unfortunately more drowning deaths.

Diana, thanks for sharing with us your experince of table data usage in your work. Table data is widely used in my work too. For example, every two weeks the upper management will have a report on each person's productivity, the number of projects worked, the number of papers written, etc.Whenever one wants to summarize data, a table is surely needed.
