Entering a PIN number for an ATM machine is an example of a permutation. The order that we enter the number matters. How is that different from a combination? Give an example of a permutation and a combination from life, and explain why each example is a permutation or combination.

****************
Per week 4 powerpoint presentation, each letter can be selected only once and no repetition is allowed for permutation. So if a letter can be repeated, like AAA in the example, it is not a permutation. When letters can be repeated, the counting process is much easier but less interesting. Though a pin can have repetition, it usually can not be very simple, usually pin needs to have at least one letter, one number, and one special character. So AAA can't be a pin. When you considering all these requirements, the counting process becomes complicated.

********************************
You pointed out the key difference between permutation and combination: the order. Order matters for permutation, but not for combination.

The ATM pin number is a permutation, even if digits can be repeated. The order of course matters. For example, 12345 is a different pin from 54321. If 112233 is the pin, 221133 won't get you through.

I saw an earlier post using candies in a bag as an example. I think we can use a similar example to illustrate permutation and combination. Suppose the bag has in it 1 yellow candy, 2 red candies, and 3 blue candies. And I pick randomly two candies from the bag. What is the probability that the first candy is yellow and the second candy is red? This is a permutation problem. If I ask what is the probability that the two candies one is yellow the other is red, this becomes a combination problem.

Rolling a pair of dice is an example of an independent event. Whatever number is rolled on the first dice doesn't change the outcome of the second dice that is rolled. Give another example of an independent and explain why it is an independent event. What is a dependent event? Give an example and explain why the example is a dependent event.


*********************************
Causality usually implies dependence, but the reverse is not necessarily true. For example, people's weight and height usually increase together, so they are dependent. But weight increase does not cause height increase, neither does height cause weight increase. The two are correlated, but there is no causality.

Well, it really depends on how you look at it. It is impossible to predict what the next rolling dice outcome will be. This is true in the sense that nobody knows what the outcome will be, including the one who rolls the dice. It is random and could be any number from 1 to 6. So nobody can be sure what's the next number will be. However, if you admit that the next number will be random and can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 any of them with equal probability, then you are making a prediction.

The odds of winning a lottery is quite small. By small, I mean less than 1 in a billion. Here is a website that I found could calculate the odds of winning a lottery. http://www.webmath.com/lottery.html. Input the numbers, the lowest and highest numbers, and it will tell you the chance of winning. For example, when I input 7, 1 and 99, the probability of winning is

1/99 × 1/98 × 1/97 × 1/96 × 1/95 = 1/8582777280. You can try it to see the odds of winning your state lottery.

This way of learning works best for me too. I like to try it first and compare my answer with the solution. If I get it wrong, I dig in and find out which step I miss. And next time, I will pay special attention when it comes to this step. It is always easy to see other people do it, because it appears so effortlessly, so that you miss the chance to appreciate the thinking process as they move from one step to the next.

I did not know you can set up a pin for snowblower. This is smart. We do have lots of pins to remember. For my work laptop, they require us to change the pin every 3 months. So I need to come up with a new permutations every three months. And old pin can not be recycled until one year after. What a lot of fun it is! Here is an interesting problem. Suppose you need to come up with a 5 digits pin, at least one of the three special characters need to be in it: !, # and $. And at least one number, at least one upper case and one lower case. How many permutations you can come up with?

One way to understand the concept of event is to connect it with "event of interest".  An event of interest is a collection of outcomes that share a common feature. For example, at least one boy in a family of 5 children is an event. People may be interested in the probability of such an event. Outcomes that have this feature include one boy, two boys, three boys, four boys and five boys, whereas the outcome that do not have this feature is all girls. In clinical trials, an event of interest may be more than one dose limiting toxicity in 3 subjects.
